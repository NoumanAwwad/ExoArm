ExoArm: Open-Source Robotic Exoskeleton Arm

ExoArm is a solo project, 3D-printable robotic exoskeleton arm designed to assist in physiotherapy. Desgined for the purpose of ensuring access to an affordable alternative to exoskeletons in less economoically developed countries. This system is built using stepper motors, flex sensors, and an Arduino-based control system, maintaining a total cost under Â£110.

## Features

- Arduino-based closed-loop control using flex sensors
- Stepper motors via Arduino driver boards
- 3D-printable design (created fully in Fusion 360)
- Fully open-source: software, and CAD fully implemented, only hardware components require purchase

## Step By Step Hardware Setup (3D printer required)

1. Print components (CAD designs found under `/cad`)
2. Attach flex sensors to any glove, using adhesive (tape, glue gun, etc)
3. Wire sensors to Arduino (diagram below)
4. Use ULN2003 to drive stepper motors
5. Upload code from `/code` directory
