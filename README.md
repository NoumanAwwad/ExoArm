ExoArm is a non profit open source exoskeleton arm meant to act as a substitute to more expensive exoskeletons in places that less financially stable/do not have access to medical exoskeletons. 
It is meant to be highly customizable so any changes to the design are encouraged in order to better suit the user/patient. 
When customizing this design please not that the creator of ExoArm does not take any responsibility for any injuiries incurred when modifying this design. The assumpltion when modifying it either electronically
or phsycially, is that you have the necessary understanding to successfully implement the changes you wish you make without incurring any damage to the arm or yourself. 

The necessary electronics for the creation of ExoArm are as follows: 

NEMA 17 Stepper motor
Matrix board
10kOhm resistor
Arduino Uno Minima R4 (or similar)
Flex Sensor
Switch
11.1V LiPO battery 650mAh (can be found here: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-panther-650mah-3s-75c-battery-pack-w-xt30.html)
A4988 Stepper Driver (the circuit will end up changing if you use the TMC2208)
10 microF capacitor (decoupling capacitor)

ExoArm will require a 3D printer in order to fabricate it. 

The neccessary hardware components are: 

5mm steel rod: https://amzn.to/3HMBGeV
Thin wall bearings: https://amzn.to/3gtYLqG and: https://amzn.to/3H7JPZY
Screws (M3 majority preferred unless physically changed)
